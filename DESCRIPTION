Title: Define Rectangular Regions with Granularity
Description: A granule is a rectangular extent with an implied discretization. The default granularity is 1x1, 
 the range is a whole divisor of itself.  This is the general concept of a raster, a rectangular window with discretization. 
 The common extent or bounding box concept can be thought of as the degenerate case (1x1).
